    "Definition of Prediction Interval\n",
    "A prediction interval is a statistical concept that provides an estimated range within which a future observation or measurement is expected to fall, with a specified level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for a random variable Y and a confidence level 1-α, a prediction interval [L, U] satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(L ≤ Y ≤ U) = 1 - α\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "L is the lower bound of the interval U is the upper bound of the interval\n",

    "Definition of Confidence Interval\n",
    "A confidence interval in statistics is a range of values that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter with a specified level of confidence. It is constructed around a point estimate and provides a measure of uncertainty.\n",

    "Mathematically, for a population parameter θ and a confidence level (1-α), where α is the significance level, the confidence interval can be expressed as:\n",
